## Reflection Responses

### Day 1: July 6, 2021

Over the course of these next 6 weeks, I hope to become more familiar with the basics of machine learning, GitHub, and working in a team setting on a machine learning project. I have taken computer science courses before, but I have never worked on a project using GitHub and other platforms besides traditional languages such as Java, C++, or Python. At the end of the program, hopefully I will be more comfortable with this environment and can start some of my own projects.

In Dr. David Kong's talk about leadership today, I learned about what it means to be a leader and how to use my storytelling ability to enact change in my community. In any leadership role, the end goal is to unite others in a common goal to accomplish something. The best way to invoke change in others is through storytelling, mentoring, identifying a common goal, developing a plan to achieve that goal, and then actually executing steps to reach that goal. I learned that storytelling is a combination of conflict, actions, and results, and a moral is created at the end of the story. During the talk today, we watched several videos showing great examples of storytelling, and in each story, the speakers evoked powerful emotions in the audience to brings about change and act. No matter what, each story ended with a glimmer of hope, which prompted the audience to act. Overall, I learned a lot about leadership today, and understand that being a leader is not about taking glory for an end goal, but it's about empowering others to become better through a common goal.

In supervised learning, the data is labeled, the model learns from feedback, and the model is expected to predict an outcome, either regression or classification. The goal of supervised learning is to create a model that can classify data or predict outcomes accurately based on labeled input and output. Overtime, the model can measure its own accuracy and gradually learn. In unsupervised learning, the model uses algorithms to analyze unlabeled data sets and draw patterns between them without the need of human intervention. Some examples of unsupervised learning are clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction. Skikit Learn is used mainly for machine learning calculations and modelling. Other libraries must be used to visualize the data.

### Day 10: July 15, 2021

I have been struggling with trying to understand the various topics of machine learning and neural networks this past week, but I have reviewed by reading some articles and watching a couple videos, so I will outline my progress of understanding here. An artificial neural network is a network of artificial neurons which take in input, perform algorithms, and output values which can solve complex problems that can normally only be performed by "intelligent" humans. The process of a neural network is as follows: input -> prediction -> calculate error -> tweak weights and biases -> repeat. The way input data flows through the neural network is that each node's input is multiplied by a weight and added to a bias. Each of these connections are summed and ran through a non-linear activation function. Non-linear activations are a way of adding non-linearity to a model in order to detect more complex patterns in the data and is a means of defining how a node's output will be expressed for the next layer. The method that the model becomes trained is through gradient descent, in which the weights and biases are tweaked in the direction that the cost function is approaching a local minimum. Forward propagation is the process of feeding input data forward through the neural network. Backward proportion is the process of using training the model using gradient descent.
