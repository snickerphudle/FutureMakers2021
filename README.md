### Day 1: July 6, 2021

Over the course of these next 6 weeks, I hope to become more familiar with the basics of machine learning, GitHub, and working in a team setting on a machine learning project. I have taken computer science courses before, but I have never worked on a project using GitHub and other platforms besides traditional languages such as Java, C++, or Python. At the end of the program, hopefully I will be more comfortable with this environment and can start some of my own projects.

In Dr. David Kong's talk about leadership today, I learned about what it means to be a leader and how to use my storytelling ability to enact change in my community. In any leadership role, the end goal is to unite others in a common goal to accomplish something. The best way to invoke change in others is through storytelling, mentoring, identifying a common goal, developing a plan to achieve that goal, and then actually executing steps to reach that goal. I learned that storytelling is a combination of conflict, actions, and results, and a moral is created at the end of the story. During the talk today, we watched several videos showing great examples of storytelling, and in each story, the speakers evoked powerful emotions in the audience to brings about change and act. No matter what, each story ended with a glimmer of hope, which prompted the audience to act. Overall, I learned a lot about leadership today, and understand that being a leader is not about taking glory for an end goal, but it's about empowering others to become better through a common goal.

In supervised learning, the data is labeled, the model learns from feedback, and the model is expected to predict an outcome, either regression or classification. The goal of supervised learning is to create a model that can classify data or predict outcomes accurately based on labeled input and output. Overtime, the model can measure its own accuracy and gradually learn. In unsupervised learning, the model uses algorithms to analyze unlabeled data sets and draw patterns between them without the need of human intervention. Some examples of unsupervised learning are clustering, association, and dimensionality reduction. Skikit Learn is used mainly for machine learning calculations and modelling. Other libraries must be used ot visualize the data.
