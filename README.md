### Day 1

Over the course of these next 6 weeks, I hope to become more familiar with the basics of machine learning, GitHub, and working in a team setting on a machine learning project. I have taken computer science courses before, but I have never worked on a project using GitHub and other platforms besides traditional languages such as Java, C++, or Python. At the end of the program, hopefully I will be more comfortable with this environment and can start some of my own projects.
